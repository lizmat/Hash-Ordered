=head1 NAME

Hash::Ordered - role for ordered Hashes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Hash::Ordered;

my %m is Hash::Ordered = a => 42, b => 666;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Exports a C<Hash::Ordered> role that can be used to indicate the implementation
of a C<Hash> in which the keys are ordered the way the C<Hash> got initialized
or any later keys got added.

Since C<Hash::Ordered> is a role, you can also use it as a base for creating
your own custom implementations of hashes.
