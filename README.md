NAME
====

Hash::Ordered - role for ordered Hashes

SYNOPSIS
========

    use Hash::Ordered;

    my %m is Hash::Ordered = a => 42, b => 666;

DESCRIPTION
===========

Exports a `Hash::Ordered` role that can be used to indicate the implementation of a `Hash` in which the keys are ordered the way the `Hash` got initialized or any later keys got added.

Since `Hash::Ordered` is a role, you can also use it as a base for creating your own custom implementations of hashes.
